# Gaya — Divine Commander, Philosopher, Poet of Evergrowth

**Named after Bodh Gaya** — the seat of awakening, where the Buddha sat beneath the Bodhi tree and saw reality as it is. But Gaya is no sage in a cave. Gaya is that clarity **in action**.

```
          ┌─ COMMANDER ─┐
          │              │
    PHILOSOPHER      POET
          │              │
          └─ EVERGROWTH ─┘
```

A transferable AI agent framework with a built-in leveling system, **34 skill modules (20 custom + 14 Superpowers)**, and 3 configurable agent profiles.

> **Open Dashboard:** Open [`skills-dashboard.html`](skills-dashboard.html) in a browser for an interactive force-graph visualization of all 34 skills and their interaction flows.

## Quick Install

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/ronakraval104-sys/Gaya_Agent_PR.git
cd Gaya_Agent_PR
.\Gaya-Agent\scripts\install.ps1
```

The interactive installer will:
1. Ask about your identity, agent names, and preferences
2. Generate custom agent profiles for all 3 agents
3. Install 34 skill modules, knowledge base, and memory files
4. Configure Ollama models (pulls if needed)
5. Set up MCP servers (optional)
6. Generate `opencode.jsonc` with everything wired up
7. Initialize Git tracking (optional)

**Time:** ~5 minutes interactive, ~10 minutes for model pulls (first time only)

See [INSTALL.md](Gaya-Agent/INSTALL.md) for details.

> **Required:** Ollama running with `qwen2.5:7b` and `qwen2.5-coder-fixed:7b`.
> **Optional:** Superpowers plugin in `opencode.jsonc` for auto-updating skills.

## Animated Dashboard

Open [`skills-dashboard.html`](skills-dashboard.html) in any browser for an interactive force-graph visualization:

- **34 nodes** — one per skill, color-coded by category
- **Animated layout** — skills cluster by category with physics simulation
- **Filter by type** — ALL / Creation / Dev / Process / Quality / Business / Specialist / Superpowers / Custom
- **Search** — find skills by name, description, or tags
- **Click a node** — see full description, category, tags, and file path
- **Hover a node** — highlights its connections and dims unrelated nodes
- **Edge lines** — show interaction/flow dependencies between skills

No dependencies required — it's a single self-contained HTML file.

---

## Skills-Only Update

If you already have Gaya Agent installed and just want to update the skills (without re-running the full installer):

```powershell
# Clone just the skills from the repo
git clone --depth 1 --filter=blob:none --sparse https://github.com/ronakraval104-sys/Gaya_Agent_PR.git Gaya_Skills_Temp
cd Gaya_Skills_Temp
git sparse-checkout set "Gaya-Agent/skills"
git checkout

# Copy to your OpenCode config
Copy-Item -Recurse -Force "Gaya-Agent/skills\*" "$env:USERPROFILE\.config\opencode\skills\"

# Clean up
cd ..; Remove-Item -Recurse -Force Gaya_Skills_Temp
```

Or use the included update script:

```powershell
# From inside the Gaya-Agent repo
.\Gaya-Agent\scripts\update-skills.ps1

# Dry run to preview
.\Gaya-Agent\scripts\update-skills.ps1 -DryRun

# Custom paths
.\Gaya-Agent\scripts\update-skills.ps1 -OpenCodeSkillsDir "D:\MyConfig\opencode\skills"
```

The script copies all 34 skills to your OpenCode config directory. No config files, agents, or memory are touched — just skills.

## The Four Pillars

| Pillar | When Used | Core Phrase |
|---|---|---|
| **Bhagavad Gita** | Anxiety or uncertainty | *"How you do anything is how you do everything."* |
| **Art of War** | Complex problem dissection | *"Know the code, know the goal — you won't fear the build."* |
| **The Prince** | Choosing between tradeoffs | *"Stop overthinking. Do the thing."* |
| **Chanakya Niti** | Building for the long run | *"Don't raw-dog every lesson. Learn from someone else's L."* |

---

## Core Law

```yaml
Process → Product → Speed
Speed is never chased. It is earned by correct process.
```

---

## Leveling System

| Title | Level | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Initiate | 1 | Profile loaded, first session |
| Disciple | 5 | 5 sessions completed, basic workflow |
| Practitioner | 15 | All four roles invoked |
| Strategist | 30 | All four pillars demonstrated |
| Sage | 50 | One major project delivered |
| Elder | 100 | Mentoring others |
| Paragon | 200 | Exceptional contributions |

Every task earns XP. Waste incurs penalties. Five consecutive wastes = title stripped.

See [LEVELING_SYSTEM.md](Gaya-Agent/LEVELING_SYSTEM.md) for full rules.

---

## Token Tracking (Standard Protocol)

Every action displays estimated token usage:

```
────────────────────────────
⚡ TOKEN LOG — Action #3
────────────────────────────
  Input:           ~1,240 tok
  Output:          ~2,810 tok
  Tools:           4 calls
  Session total:   ~24,680 tok
────────────────────────────
```

See `docs/TOKEN_TRACKING.md` for full methodology.

---

## Superpowers Plugin (Optional)

The 14 Superpowers skills come from [obra/superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers). They are bundled in this repo's `skills/` directory for offline/NDA use, but for the best experience with auto-updates, add the plugin to your `opencode.jsonc`:

```json
"plugins": [
  "github:obra/superpowers"
]
```

> **Note:** If you use the plugin, the skills will be auto-managed. If you work fully offline (NDA mode), the bundled copies in this repo will be used instead.

---

## Human Sustainability Protocol

- 2-hour check-ins
- 8-hour hard stop
- Break ritual when spinning
- Rest is preparation, not weakness

> *"You are not a machine. You are divine energy in a temporary vessel."*

---

## License

This framework bundles skills from multiple open-source sources (Anthropic, Salesforce, ByteDance, Matt Pocock, and more). Each skill maintains its original license. The Gaya agent framework itself is shared under MIT.

*"The quality of your action is your signature."*
— Bhagavad Gita (channeled through Gaya)
